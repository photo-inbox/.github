## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*Are you using to-do apps in your day-to-day life? I do, and it is really easy to use from the desktop: you do your stuff, come up with some idea in the middle of it, quickly write it down in your to-do app to go over it later, and come back to the stuff you were doing. But to do the same from a smartphone... let's be honest, typing on a smartphone is a pain (otherwise nobody would use voice messagesðŸ˜…), but it has a camera! So meet your first photo-based to-do app! Now you can "write down" your to-dos with a phone as fast as you do it on the desktop!ðŸ¤¯*
